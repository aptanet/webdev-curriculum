#Learning Objectives
+ Styling and animation with CSS:
	+ Introducing `@keyframes` rule for defining steps in an animation.
	+ Reinforcing the use of properties to define the size, shape, position and colour of elements on a webpage.

#Challenges
+ "Diagonal animation" - editing animation `@keyframe` properties to use left:;
+ "Improve the sky" - add more keyframes and setting background:.
+ "More animation" - animate more images or elements using a variety of CSS properties. 

#Frequently Asked Questions

+ This project makes use of the javascript `prefixfree.js` library, to allow animation compatibility between browsers. If this library isn't used, then children using older browsers will instead need to declare an animation for their browser, for example:

```
animation: sky 10s infinite; 		  	//for all newer browsers
-webkit-animation: sky 10s infinite;  	// For Webkit browsers(Chrome, Safari...)
-moz-animation: sky 10s infinite;     	// For Mozilla browsers
-o-animation: sky 10s infinite;       	// For Opera browsers
-ms-animation: sky 10s infinite;		// For Microsoft browsers 
```
