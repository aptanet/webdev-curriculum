#Introduction:
In this project, children will be introduced to linear and radial gradients in CSS. They will also learn more about borders and positioning. 

#Online Resources

We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write HTML & CSS online. This project contains the following trinkets:

+ ['Intro to HTML and CSS' starting point -- jumpto.cc/web-intro](http://jumpto.cc/web-intro)
+ ['Sunrise' starting point  -- jumpto.cc/web-sunrise](http://jumpto.cc/web-sunrise)

Children can also make use of this blank trinket [(jumpto.cc/trinket-blank)](http://jumpto.cc/trinket-blank) to write their own HTML & CSS, or alternatively they can use this template trinket [(jumpto.cc/trinket-template)](http://jumpto.cc/trinket-template).

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:
