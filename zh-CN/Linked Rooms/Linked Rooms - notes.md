#Introduction:
In this project, children are introduced to multiple linked web pages in the same project each with their own CSS file. 


#Online Resources

We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write HTML & CSS online. This project contains the following trinket:

+ ['Linked Rooms' starting point  -- jumpto.cc/web-rooms](http://jumpto.cc/web-rooms)

Children can also make use of this blank trinket [(jumpto.cc/trinket-blank)](http://jumpto.cc/trinket-blank) to write their own HTML & CSS, or alternatively they can use this template trinket [(jumpto.cc/trinket-template)](http://jumpto.cc/trinket-template).

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

+ ['Linked Rooms Finished' -- https://trinket.io/html/ba5d27ec68](https://trinket.io/html/ba5d27ec68)
