#Introduction:
In this project, children will have an opportunity to write their own HTML. They will create their own story, adding panels, images and captions to a comic book style webpage.

#Online Resources

We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write HTML & CSS online. This project contains the following trinkets:

+ ['Tell a Story' starting point -- jumpto.cc/web-story](http://jumpto.cc/web-story)

Children can also make use of this blank trinket [(jumpto.cc/trinket-blank)](http://jumpto.cc/trinket-blank) to write their own HTML & CSS, or alternatively they can use this template trinket [(jumpto.cc/trinket-template)](http://jumpto.cc/trinket-template).

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

+ ['Tell a Story' Finished](https://trinket.io/html/c8afdef912)

#Offline Resources
This project can be [completed offline](../html-css.html) if preferred. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' folder, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This folder includes the following files:

+ Template/Template.html
+ Template/style.css
+ Tell a Story/Story.html
+ Tell a Story/style.css
+ Tell a Story/buildings.png
+ Tell a Story/sun.png

You can also find a completed version of this project's challenges in the 'Club Leader Resources' folder, which contains:

+ StoryFinished.html
+ style.css
+ boy.png
+ girl.png

#Learning Objectives
+ Writing HTML:
	+ `<div>` tag and element grouping;
	+ `<img>` tag and image URLs;
	+ `<h1>` - `<h6>` headings.

#Challenges
+ "Make some changes" - editing HTML content and CSS style;
+ "Keep going!" - applying tags and styling to create a finished story.

#Using this project offline
+ If children are completing this project offline, they'll need to save images they intend to use in the same folder as their `Story.html` file.

	They can then just add the name of the file in their `<img>` tags:

	```
		<img src="house.png" />
	```
